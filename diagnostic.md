# Ember Routing Diagnostic

Record your responses inside the fenced code blocks below each question.

1.  What are the main task(s) you perform inside the Ember Application Router,
    and what are the main task(s) you perform inside an Ember Route?

    ```md
  router.js -  On object Router by method .map I can add many routes from a folder
  routes by method .route
    ```

1.  What is the command to generate a route named `boston` nested under
    `campus`?

    ```md
    ember generate route boston
    ```

1.  Suppose you have a nested route at the URL `/campus/boston`. How would you
    use the `link-to` helper to generate an appropriate link?

    ```md
    <#link-to 'campus' boston></link-to>
    ```

1.  Explain **at least** two differences between the following two route
    definitions.

    ```js
    this.route('products', function () {
      this.route('product', { path: '/:product_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€here
    });

    this.route('product', { path: '/products/:product_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    ```md
    the first one will refer to the index route by ember default
    the second one will refer to products route
    ```

1.  Suppose we have the following route definition:

    ```js
    this.route('movie', { path: '/movies/:movie_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    If we navigate in the browser to `/movies/123`, how can we reference the
    value `'123'` inside a Route?

    ```md
    this.route{'movie', path: '/movies/:movie_id' }
    ```

1.  Inside a template, how do we reference data provided by a Route?

    ```md
    {{#link-to 'lists'}}here{{/link-to}}
    ```
